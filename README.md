# TriMap
TriMap is an image creation program on an isometric projection grid. Use the menu to build maps for Dungeons and Dragons to keep track of your party.
TriMap was written by Pouya Mahdi Gholami, Griffin Mareske, and Philip Kiely at HackISU '17. TriMap was written using the Konva library and was inspired by a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5vxflq/i_drew_this_yesterday_i_love_drawing_in_isometric/). It is available under the GPL version 3 liscence.
